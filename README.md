# Story

The Plains - a CLI adventure game where your choices matter. You're Liam, a space traveler who has crash-landed on a mysterious planet. What will you find? What will you discover?

# Development Timeline

Late January 2021 - The idea was conceived, and written in C.

Mid Febuary 2021 - The Plains was fully rewritten in Python due to complications with C

**Early April 2021 (planned) - The Plains will be fully rewritten in Ruby.**

# Why is The Plains switching to a Ruby codebase?

Ruby enables me to make The Plains more efficient and distributable than on Python.

You can follow the development process of the new codebase [here](https://github.com/draumaz/plains-rb)!
