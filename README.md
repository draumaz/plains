# Story

What happens when a random spaceflight employee becomes stranded on a faraway, alien planet? The Plains is about Liam, a goat who truly just intended to perform a delivery, but ended up here instead. You're in uncharted territory, too, so all bets are off. Will you be peaceful to what you find, or will you do whatever it takes to survive?
