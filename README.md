# Story

- What happens when a random spaceflight employee becomes stranded on a faraway, alien planet? 
- In The Plains, you are Liam, a delivery goat who _truly_ just intended to perform a mundane sale, but ended up here. 
- Will you act peacefully towards what you find, or will you do whatever it takes to survive?
