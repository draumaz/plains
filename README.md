# Notice

I am currently rewriting The Plains, transferring from Python to C++. The old code has been frozen and can be accessed <a href="https://github.com/draumaz/plains-py/">here</a>.

# Story

The Plains is a game about You, a goat named Liam. You've crash landed on the surface of a distant planet, with much to explore. What will you discover? And how will you go about it? Will you be peaceful, or will you hurt others?
